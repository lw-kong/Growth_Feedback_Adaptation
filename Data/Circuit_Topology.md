The files 'iffl.txt' and 'nfb.txt' are for the three-node circuits studied in this work. They come from the paper Shi, Wenjia, et al. "Adaptation with transcriptional regulation." Scientific reports 7.1 (2017): 42648.

The files '4n70.txt' and '4n98.txt' are for the four-node circuits studied in this work.

Each row represents one circuit topology. The first column is a circuit index. All the following columns represent the link connections of the (directed) regulatory network among the circuit nodes. For instance, the column 'bc' represents the link from node B to node C. It can have three different values:
 - 1: activation
 - -1: inhibition
 - 0: null, no connection
