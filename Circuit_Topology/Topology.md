Each row represents one circuit topology. The first column is a circuit index. All the following columns represent the link connections of the (directed) regulatory network among the circuit nodes. For instance, the column 'bc' represents the link from node B to node C. It can have three different values:
 - 1: activation
 - -1: inhibition
 - 0: null, no connection
